 Loveland Factory DooM WADs
 Vanilla Compatible - Under 100 Visplanes

This release has two WADs. 

LOVELAND.WAD - Vanilla-DOOM compatible.  Runs in V1.9 of the actual DOOM2.EXE.  Level appears at MAP01.

Loveland Factory.wad - GZDoom compatible; Brutal DOOM mod compatible but not needed.  This has a MAPINFO with a 1-level episode and ending like Serenity Castle, just start the game, or enter "MAP START" to restart.

Thanks for checking out these WADs.

## Story

## About these WADs

Before this, I created Serenity Castle.  Serenity Castle is a huge-ass WAD that absolutely smashes every limit in vanilla Doom.  It also crashes Visplane Explorer in Doom Builder 2.

This level is nowhere near as big as Serenity Castle.  It's still complex, though.

I wanted to create a WAD that worked within Vanilla DOOM's limitations, in addition to seeing how customizing screens and music for that worked.

The visplane count doesn't get to above 100 and the map was carefully tested and retested to attempt to eliminate all drawseg overflows - these were more of a problem than trying to stay under 128 visplanes.

There are no Spider Masterminds or Cyberdemons in this WAD.

## Requirements

This WAD was developed on an old PC (AMD Athlon dual-core with 6GB of RAM).  

LOVELAND.WAD was tested using V1.9 of DOOM.EXE in DosBOX.  All limitations of Vanilla Doom were taken into account.   It was not tested as much as the GZDoom-compatible WAD, because I'm too addicted to freelook.  

## Hints

- You can shoot a wall somewhere to reveal a secret.  You don't really need this secret.  Because of this it's not marked as a secret.

- Resist the temptation to shoot barrels on sight, some may help you later.

- The switch guarded by the Mancubus is essential to progressing, though you won't know why until later.

- The switch behind the red-key door opens a door, but you won't see it until you circle back around.

- When you open the blue-key door (not the one that leads to outside), watch your back.

- Generally, watch your back throughout the whole WAD.

- And your front.  Basically, watch all directions.
