 Loveland Factory DooM WAD (Vanilla DOOM Compatible)

Thanks for checking out this WAD.  

## Story

A few years ago, UAC decommissioned an Earth-based factory, known as Loveland Factory.  So there's old equipment everywhere and the place is falling apart.  Also, some portal to Hell was left open because there's demons and zombified humans.  So, kill them all and get out of there.

## About this WAD

Before this, I created Serenity Castle.  Serenity Castle is a huge-ass WAD that absolutely smashes every limit in vanilla Doom.  It also crashes Visplane Explorer in Doom Builder 2.

This is a fairly tame level that won't pose an extremely serious challenge to seasoned players, but is hopefully still fun.

I wanted to create a WAD that will work in Vanilla Doom.  I also wanted to experiment and see how customizing screens and music in Vanilla Doom worked.

The visplane count doesn't get to above 100 and the map was carefully tested and retested to attempt to eliminate all drawseg overflows - these were more of a problem than trying to stay under 128 visplanes.

## Requirements

This WAD was developed on an old PC (AMD Athlon dual-core with 6GB of RAM).  

It was tested using I think V1.666 of DOOM.EXE in DosBOX.  All limitations of Vanilla Doom were taken into account.  You will have more fun playing in GZDoom with freelook enabled, of course, but certainly not required.
