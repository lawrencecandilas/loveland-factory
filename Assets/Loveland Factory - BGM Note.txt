The OGG track that's part of the GZDoom-compatible WAD was composed using FL Studio 7.0 XXL v7.0.0.

The following software VSTs were used:
- PlastiCZ (version 1.0)
- JunoX
- SynthOne

The MIDI track that's part of the vanilla DOOM compatible WAD was composed using onlinesequencer.net.

I didn't spend very much time on it.
